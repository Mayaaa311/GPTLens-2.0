However, there is no check on whether the current owner is also null before allowing the ownership transfer.

If they were able to calculate and set cnt to a higher value, they could attempt to steal all the tokens. An attacker could potentially create a batchTransfer transaction that attempts to transfer more tokens than are available to the contract."
