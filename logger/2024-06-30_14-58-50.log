The following are the accepted types of bugs:
- XSS (Cross Site Scripting): A type of injection where user input is embedded into a web page. It exploits client side scripting vulnerabilities.
- SQL Injection: A type of injection where special characters in a query string or form submission can be used to alter database queries.
- RCE (Remote Code Execution): When the attacker takes control of your system and execute a code on it that is not intended by you.
- Brute Force Attack: An automated way to guess valid passwords. It usually involves a dictionary attack or some kind of automation to try all possible combinations with different words.
- Denial of Service (DoS): When a hacker sends large amounts of data to your server and causes it to crash, the targeted system will not be available for normal users
