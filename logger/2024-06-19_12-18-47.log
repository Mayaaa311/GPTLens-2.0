Award-winning R&B artist Ne-Yo stopped by the studio to talk about his new album Non-Fiction, which was released last month on Motown Records. Ne-Yo shared stories about meeting with some of today's top producers including Timbaland and Stargate for this project. He also discussed what he looks for in a song that is meant for a film soundtrack or his own album.
Ne-Yo has already racked up 10 Grammy nominations and three wins, and now he's making room to win an Oscar. The R&B crooner took his talents to the big screen in Think Like A Man Too and he's currently working on a new movie that'll be released next year.
