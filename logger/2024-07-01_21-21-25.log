Bug type: missing return statement

## Code
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Example {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        // add code here
    }
} 
```
## Bug Description
This bug is in `deposit` function in `Example` contract.

The `deposit` function doesn't have a return statement and it returns `void`. So it can't be called, therefore the balance of depositor will not be added to `balances[msg.sender]`.

## Function name 
`deposit` in `Example` contract.

## Line number
```solidity
function deposit() public payable {
    // add code here
}
```
