1. The function `getTokens()` in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `msg.value` is used to calculate the number of tokens to be distributed, but the `distr()` function is called without checking if the contract has enough tokens to distribute. This allows an attacker to call the `getTokens()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds by calling the `getTokens()` function multiple times. The `distr()` function should be modified to check if the contract has enough tokens to distribute before calling it. 2. The function `adminClaimAirdrop()` in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `doAirdrop()` function is called without checking if the contract has enough tokens to distribute. This allows an attacker to call the `adminClaimAirdrop()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds by calling the `adminClaimAirdrop()` function multiple times. The `doAirdrop()` function should be modified to check if the contract has enough tokens to distribute before calling it. 3. The function `adminClaimAirdropMultiple()` in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `doAirdrop()` function is called without checking if the contract has enough tokens to distribute. This allows an attacker to call the `adminClaimAirdropMultiple()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds by calling the `adminClaimAirdropMultiple()` function multiple times. The `doAirdrop()` function should be modified to check if the contract has enough tokens to distribute before calling it. 4. The function `updateTokensPerEth()` in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `tokensPerEth` variable is updated without checking if the contract has enough tokens to distribute. This allows an attacker to call the `updateTokensPerEth()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds by calling the `updateTokensPerEth()` function multiple times. The `tokensPerEth` variable should be updated to check if the contract has enough tokens to distribute before updating it. 5. The function `getTokens()` in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `msg.value` is used to calculate the number of tokens to be distributed, but the `distr()` function is called without checking if the contract has enough tokens to distribute. This allows an attacker to call the `getTokens()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds by calling the `getTokens()` function multiple times. The `distr()` function should be modified to check if the contract has enough tokens to distribute before calling it.
