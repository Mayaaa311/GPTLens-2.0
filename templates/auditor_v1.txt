Q: You are a smart contract auditor, identify and explain severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract. Make sure that they are exploitable in real world and beneficial to attackers. Provide each identified vulnerability with intermediate reasoning and its associated function. Remember, you must provide the entire function code and do not use "...". Make your reasoning comprehensive and detailed. Smart contract code:
{code}
\nYou should only output in below json format:
{{
    "output_list": [
        {{
            "function_name": "<function_name_1>",
            "code": "<original_function_code_1>",
            "vulnerability": "<short_vulnera_desc_1>",
            "reason": "<reason_1>"
        }},
        {{
            "function_name": "<function_name_2>",
            "code": "<original_function_code_2>",
            "vulnerability": "<short_vulnera_desc_2>",
            "reason": "<reason_2>"
        }}
    ]
}}

Output {topk} most severe vulnerabilities(they should not be the same bug)
If no vulnerability is detected, you should only output in this json format {{"output_list": []}}.\n
