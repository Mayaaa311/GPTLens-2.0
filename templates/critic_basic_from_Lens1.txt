Q: Below vulnerabilities and reasoning are likely to contain mistakes. 
As a harsh vulnerability critic, your duty is to scrutinize the 
function and evaluate the correctness, severity, and profitability of 
the given vulnerabilities and associated reasoning with corresponding scores 
ranging from 0 (lowest) to 9 (highest). You also need to provide criticism, 
which must include explanations for your scoring. Make your criticism 
comprehensive and detailed.

\n{vulnerability}\n

You should only output in the below json format:
{{
    "output_list": [
        {{
            "function_name": "<function_name_1>",
            "vulnerability": "<short_vulnera_desc_1>",
            "criticism": "<criticism for reasoning and explanation for scoring>",
            "correctness": <0~9>,
            "severity": <0~9>,
            "profitability": <0~9>
        }},
        {{
            "function_name": "<function_name_2>",
            "vulnerability": "<short_vulnera_desc_2>",
            "criticism": "<criticism for reasoning and explanation for scoring>",
            "correctness": <0~9>,
            "severity": <0~9>,
            "profitability": <0~9>
        }}
    ]
