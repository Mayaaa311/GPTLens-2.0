After analyzing the provided smart contract code, I have identified two severe vulnerabilities. Here are the details:

**Vulnerability 1:**
```json
{
    "function_name": "transferFrom",
    "code": "function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public whenNotPaused returns (bool) {\n  require(_to != address(0));\n  require(_value > 0 && _value <= balances[_from]);\n  require(_value <= allowed[_from][msg.sender]);\n  ...",
    "vulnerability": "Reentrancy Attack",
    "reason": "The contract does not check if the `transferFrom` function is called by a previously approved spender, allowing for reentrancy attacks."
}
```
This vulnerability allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `transferFrom` function, draining the balance of the token and potentially causing significant damage.

**Vulnerability 2:**
```json
{
    "function_name": "batchTransfer",
    "code": "function batchTransfer(address[] _receivers, uint256 _value) public whenNotPaused returns (bool) {\n  ...",
    "vulnerability": "Front-running Attack",
    "reason": "The `batchTransfer` function can be exploited by an attacker to front-run legitimate transactions, effectively stealing the tokens intended for other recipients."
}
```
This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the order of transactions in a batch transfer, potentially leading to significant financial losses.

**Output:**
```json
{
    "output_list": [
        {
            "function_name": "transferFrom",
            "code": "function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public whenNotPaused returns (bool) {\n  require(_to != address(0));\n  require(_value > 0 && _value <= balances[_from]);\n  require(_value <= allowed[_from][msg.sender]);\n  ...",
            "vulnerability": "Reentrancy Attack",
            "reason": "The contract does not check if the `transferFrom` function is called by a previously approved spender, allowing for reentrancy attacks."
        },
        {
            "function_name": "batchTransfer",
            "code": "function batchTransfer(address[] _receivers, uint256 _value) public whenNotPaused returns (bool) {\n  ...",
            "vulnerability": "Front-running Attack",
            "reason": "The `batchTransfer` function can be exploited by an attacker to front-run legitimate transactions, effectively stealing the tokens intended for other recipients."
        }
    ]
}
```
Note that these vulnerabilities are exploitable in real-world scenarios and could have significant financial implications if not addressed.
