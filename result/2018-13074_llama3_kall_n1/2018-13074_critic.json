As a harsh vulnerability critic, I will scrutinize the provided vulnerabilities and evaluate their correctness, severity, and profitability.

**Vulnerability 1: Reentrancy Attack in the `_transfer` function of `FIBToken`**

* Correctness: 7/9 (The reasoning is correct that the function does not check if the `_from` or `_to` addresses are contract addresses. However, it's not entirely accurate to state that this leads to a reentrancy attack and drain funds from the `FIBToken` contract.)
	+ Criticism: The vulnerability is more accurately described as an unchecked transfer of value between contracts, which could lead to unintended consequences. A reentrancy attack typically involves a contract calling another contract, which in turn calls back to the original contract, creating a loop. This vulnerability does not explicitly facilitate such a scenario.
* Severity: 6/9 (While this vulnerability has the potential to cause issues, it's not as severe as a true reentrancy attack.)
	+ Criticism: The severity of this vulnerability is reduced due to its limited scope and lack of explicit facilitation for reentrancy attacks.
* Profitability: 5/9 (An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to drain funds from the `FIBToken` contract, but it would require a significant amount of effort and resources.)
	+ Criticism: The profitability of this vulnerability is reduced due to its limited scope and the need for an attacker to invest considerable time and resources.

**Vulnerability 2: Unchecked Transfer of Ownership in the `transferOwnership` function of `owned`**

* Correctness: 8/9 (The reasoning is correct that the function does not check if the new owner is a contract address or not.)
	+ Criticism: None
* Severity: 8/9 (This vulnerability has the potential to cause significant issues, as it allows an attacker to take control of the contract and potentially drain funds.)
	+ Criticism: The severity of this vulnerability is high due to its ability to facilitate a reentrancy attack.
* Profitability: 8/9 (An attacker could easily exploit this vulnerability to take control of the contract and drain funds, making it highly profitable.)
	+ Criticism: This vulnerability is highly profitable due to its simplicity and potential for significant financial gain.
