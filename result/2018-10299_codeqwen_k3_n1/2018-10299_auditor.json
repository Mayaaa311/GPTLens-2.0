    "reason": "The current implementation of the `transferFrom` function doesn't handle overflows. If the sender has enough balance but not enough allowance for the recipient, an attacker can bypass the allowance limit by transferring more tokens than they should be able to."

    "reason": "The current implementation of the `batchTransfer` function doesn't check if the array of receivers is empty or too long. An attacker can use this vulnerability to transfer tokens to a large number of addresses without paying for each transaction individually."
