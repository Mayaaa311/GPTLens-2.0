    "bug_description": "The function `mintToken` does not check if the total supply exceeds its limit. This can lead to an overflow of the uint256 variable `totalSupply`, causing unexpected behavior or even a contract failure.",
    "function_name": "mintToken",

    "correctness_score": 4,
    "correctness_reasoning": "The bug is not immediately critical because it requires a specific condition to be met for an overflow to occur. However, if the total supply limit is known and fixed at deployment or initialization, this oversight could lead to unexpected behavior when minting tokens. The potential severity increases with more extensive use of the contract where token issuance might be dynamic.",
    "severity_score": 3,

    "bug_type": "Arithmetic Error",

    "bug_description": "The function `burn` incorrectly subtracts the amount from balance without checking for underflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior or a contract failure if the balance becomes negative.",
    "function_name": "burn",
    "line_number": 102,
    "correctness_score": 5,
    "correctness_reasoning": "This bug is critical because it directly manipulates the state of the contract without any checks for potential underflows. An unchecked subtraction can lead to a negative balance, which will cause operations that rely on this value to fail.",
    "severity_score": 4,
    "severity_reasoning": "The severity increases with the direct impact on token balances and the potential for contract failure if not handled properly. This bug could lead to significant financial loss or operational disruptions in a real-world scenario."

    "correctness_score": 3,

    "severity_score": 5,
    "severity_reasoning": "The severity is high due to the potential for financial loss if an attacker can exploit this vulnerability. Reentrancy attacks can drain funds from the contract by repeatedly calling transfer functions, especially during token transfers."
