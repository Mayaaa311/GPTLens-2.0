      "code": "contract FIBToken is owned, TokenERC20 {}",
      "bug_description": "The function `mintToken` does not check if the total supply exceeds its limit. This can lead to an overflow of the uint256 variable `totalSupply`, causing unexpected behavior or even a contract failure.",
      "function_name": "mintToken",
      "line_number": 79,
      "correctness_score": 4,
      "correctness_reasoning": "The bug is not immediately critical because it requires a specific condition to be met for an overflow to occur. However, if the total supply limit is known and fixed at deployment or initialization, this oversight could lead to unexpected behavior when minting tokens. The potential severity increases with more extensive use of the contract where token issuance might be dynamic.",
