2024-07-12 10:07:53,191 - INFO - response from auditor 1: Here is the identified bug:

{
"bug_type": "Reentrancy Bug",
"code": "_transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal { ... }",
"bug_description": "This function does not check if the balance of the sender has enough tokens to transfer. This allows for reentrancy attacks where a contract can repeatedly call this function and drain the sender's balance.",
"function_name": "_transfer",
"line_number": 34
}

Note: The bug is located in the `_transfer` function on line 34, which is part of the `FIBToken` contract.
