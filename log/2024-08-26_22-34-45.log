This code contains several issues, including a potential vulnerability in the `transfer` function. The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library for mathematical operations which are used to prevent overflow and underflow between integer variables, ensuring that no invalid operation occurs due to arithmetic errors during execution of smart contracts_deployed := false;
